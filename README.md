The project aimed to develop a document outlining online movie ticket sales for a business. 
We produced a PRD document, covering feasibility, stakeholders, and functional/non-functional requirements. 
This guided an Architecture Design document, illustrating departmental relationships, feature implementations, and system reflections.
